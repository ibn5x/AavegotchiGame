# AavegotchiGame
Aavegotchi Explorer Demo for Aavegotchi Jam

Hi I wanted to participate in the Aavegotchi Gaame Jaam so I built a simple game using phaser library, it has web3 integration, wallet merging feature, moralis backend, 
game logic and lose state. I plan to continue to build out this game and integrate it with the Aavegotchi protocol in the near future. You can play it now by visiting 
the link and connecting your metamask Wallet.
