# AavegotchiGame
Aavegotchi Explorer Demo for Aavegotchi Jam

Hi I wanted to participate in the Aavegotchi Gaame Jaam so I built a simple game using phaser library, it has web3 integration, wallet merging feature, moralis backend, 
game logic and lose state. You can play it now by visiting the link and connecting your metamask Wallet.
